# Code Quality Rules

## Zero Warnings

Build MUST complete with 0 warnings and 0 errors. Every warning is a potential bug.

---

## Nullable Handling

The null-forgiving operator (`!`) is prohibited except when ALL conditions are met:
1. Value is proven non-null at that point
2. Compiler cannot infer this due to analysis limitations
3. Comment explains why it is safe
4. No reasonable restructuring alternative exists

Nullable handling patterns:
- For possibly null value, USE `?? throw new InvalidOperationException()`
- For null check, USE `if (x is null) return;`
- For optional value, DECLARE as nullable type `T?`
- For constructor parameter, USE `?? throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(param))`

---

## Reliability Principles

- MUST make illegal states unrepresentable using the type system
- MUST validate at boundaries by checking all inputs at system edges
- MUST fail fast by throwing early rather than propagating bad state
- MUST be explicit and never rely on implicit behavior or defaults

---

## Code Longevity

- MUST use stable, documented APIs
- MUST avoid implementation-specific tricks
- MUST document reasoning, not mechanics

---

## Commenting

### Core Principle

Comments exist for future readers with no conversation context. The codebase stands alone.

### Prohibited Comments

- NEVER use `// TODO:` comments
- NEVER use `// HACK:` comments
- NEVER use `// FIXME:` comments
- NEVER use `#pragma warning disable`
- NEVER use `[SuppressMessage]` attributes
- NEVER use `var x = value!;` without justification comment
- NEVER write comments referencing prompts: "As requested", "Per instruction", "Added because asked"
- NEVER write comments referencing conversation: "As discussed", "Per our conversation", "Following the plan"
- NEVER write meta-comments: "NEW:", "CHANGED:", "This is the fix"
- NEVER write obvious descriptions: "Loop through list", "Return result", "Check if null"
- NEVER write comments that would not make sense 2 years later without conversation context
- NEVER write XML documentation on internal implementation classes
- NEVER describe what code does when code is self-explanatory
- NEVER ignore compiler warnings
- NEVER suppress warnings instead of fixing root cause

### Required Comments

- MUST document non-obvious behavior: security implications, order dependencies
- MUST document external requirements: RFC references, spec compliance
- MUST document edge cases: intentional empty returns, fail-safe defaults
- MUST document reasoning: why this approach, not what it does

### Comment Decision

1. Is this obvious from the code? → No comment
2. Does this reference conversation? → No comment
3. Would future reader need this context? → Comment
4. Is there non-obvious reasoning? → Comment

## XML Documentation

XML docs (`///`) belong on interfaces only. Implementations do not require XML documentation.

- Public interface MUST have XML docs
- Interface methods MUST have XML docs
- Implementation class MUST NOT have XML docs
- Implementation methods MUST NOT have XML docs
